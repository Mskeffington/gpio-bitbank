* GPIO bitbank DT bindings

GPIO bitbank takes a set of GPIOs and exposes them as a signed integer in the sysfs

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be "gpio-bitbank"
- gpios: a set of gpios (at least two) to be decoded to an unsigned integer with
		first entry representing the MSB.

Optional Properties:
- label: The label for this device. If omitted, the label is taken from the node
		name. It has to uniquely identify a device, i.e. no other platform device
		can be assigned the same label.

Example:
	hwrev {
		compatible = "gpio-bitbank";
		label = "hardware_revision"
		gpios = <&gpio1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				<&gpio1 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				<&gpio2 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				<&gpio2 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};
